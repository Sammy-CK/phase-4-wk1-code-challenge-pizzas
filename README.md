# phase-4-wk1-code-challenge-pizzas
This is a simple RESTful API that allows users to manage pizzas, restaurants and the pizzas they serve. It is built with Ruby on Rails.

We have three models: Restaurant, Pizza, and RestaurantPizza.


## Use this link to access the api and add endpoints to perform requests:
                https://pizzas-sv6f.onrender.com/


## Models

The following relationships have been established:

- A `Restaurant` has many `Pizzas` through `RestaurantPizza`

- A `Pizza` has many `Restaurants` through `RestaurantPizza`

- A `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant` and belongs to a `Pizza`

## Validations

The RestaurantPizza model has a validation that requires the price to be between 1 and 30.

**Routes**

The following routes have been set up:

- GET `/restaurants`: Returns a list of all restaurants in the database
- GET `/restaurants/:id`: Returns information about a specific restaurant, including the pizzas it serves
- DELETE `/restaurants/:id`: Deletes a specific restaurant and any associated `RestaurantPizza`s.
- GET `/pizzas`: Returns a list of all pizzas in the database
- POST `/restaurant_pizzas`: Creates a new `RestaurantPizza` and associates it with an existing `Pizza` and `Restaurant`

**Errors**

If a request is made with invalid parameters, the API will respond with a JSON error message.

If a request is made to incorrect resources, the API will respond with a JSON error message.
